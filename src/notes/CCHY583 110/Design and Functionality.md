CANDU nuclear power plants generated electricity like most thermal electricity stations, which include fossil-fuelled stations as well as most other commercial nuclear stations in the world:

Heat is used to boil water, which turns into pressurized steam, which flows through a turbine, which turns an electrical generator which makes electricity, thought this process chemical energy (heat) is converted to kinetic energy and finally to electrical energy

The main difference between all the thermal stations is the source of heat. in fossil fuelled stations the heat is generated by burning resources like coal, oil or natural gas. In nuclear staton the heat is generated by the nuclear fission of uranium. 

CANDU reactor is a heavy water moderated reactor. Heavy water is the key to many of the unique features of the CANDU design, including its ability to run on a variety of fuel types and many of its inherent safety features. 

CANDU can use either natural uranium or enriched uranium fuel, and either heavy water (D2O) or regular (or  "light") water (H2O) as coolant (the moderator and coolant are separate system). 


#### What is Nuclear fission?
The CANDU reactor operates on the principle of nuclear fission, a process where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more fragments, releasing an immense amount of energy. Nuclear fission was discovered in the early 20th century and played a pivotal role in nuclear energy development. At the heart of this process, large atomic nuclei, such as uranium, are bombarded with neutrons, causing them to split and release energy, along with additional neutrons that can initiate further fission reactions—creating a chain reaction.


In a CANDU reactor, the primary fuel is natural uranium, consisting mainly of uranium-238 isotopes with a small amount of uranium-235. When a neutron collides with the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom, the nucleus becomes unstable and splits. This process releases energy in the form of heat and radiation, along with more neutrons. These neutrons are crucial because they continue to collide with other uranium atoms, sustaining the chain reaction necessary to generate power.


The reaction must be carefully controlled to ensure it doesn’t accelerate uncontrollably. To maintain the balance, CANDU reactors use heavy water (deuterium oxide) as a moderator. This heavy water slows down the fast neutrons produced during fission, increasing the likelihood of further fission reactions in uranium-235 atoms. Unlike light water, heavy water does not absorb neutrons as easily, allowing the reactor to operate efficiently using natural uranium rather than enriched fuel.


The energy released during fission primarily appears as heat, which is transferred by the heavy water coolant to a secondary loop, where it is used to generate steam. The steam drives turbines that produce electricity. The entire process highlights the sophisticated engineering of the CANDU reactor, allowing it to harness the energy of nuclear fission efficiently and safely.

##### Differences From other Reactors

On-line refuelling in a CANDU reactor us a unique trait that is a major advantage over reactors such as the pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors and boiling water reactors. the CANDU has the ability to refuel while the reactor is still running whereas other reactors must shut down completely, lowering their capacity factor.

Reactor Configuration

The reactor configuration of a CANDU differs from other typical reactors, as fuel bundles are arranged horizontally rather then vertically, and placed inside pressure tubes within a vessel (called the calandria).the core of a CANDU  reactor needs to be larger then comparable light water reactor however if it wants to achieve the same output capacity, and this is due to the CANDU's use of natural uranium.

There are several hundred pressure tubes within a CANDU, with exact amounts differing between reactors. the coolant flows through these pressure tubes, watch of which are enclised within a calandria tube, the pressure tubes and caladrai tubes are sprarated by spacers, in order to keep the coolant and the moderator separate the space betwen these tube is filled with carbon dioxide, which acts as a thermal insulator in order to limit heat loss to the moderator.

The reactor building that the CANDU is placed in is made of thick concrete and steel walls, with the walls of newer buildings also filled with hundreds of tonnes of water and thick steel balls to provide additional shielding.
