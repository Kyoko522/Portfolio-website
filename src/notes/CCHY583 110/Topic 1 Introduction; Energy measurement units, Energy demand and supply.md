##### Energy and work 

==**Work**==:  A force is said to do work if, when acting, there is a displacement of the point application in the direction of the force

`Work = Force (N) * Distance (m) = N*m = J`

The unit for work is Newton

##### Power
`Power = Work/Time = J/S = W`

`1W = 1J/1S`

##### Forms of Energy

Kinetic energy: is due to movement 
E(k) = 1/2 mV^2

Potential energy: is due to position or composition
E(p) = mgh
