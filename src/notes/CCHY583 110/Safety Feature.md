### Passive Safety Features

The passive features in a CANDU include:

- **Bending of the fuel channels in the event of overheating** due to the CANDU's horizontal configuration, which will in turn slow down the rate of reaction. This is caused by the fact that the fuel rods are aligned in the ideal position for reactivity, and any bend in a fuel channel causes the reaction to slow because of wasted neutrons that do not hit their intended targets.[[13]](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/CANDU_reactor#cite_note-Ref6-13)

- **[Control rods](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Control_rod "Control rod") held up by electromagnets**, which in the absence of a power signal are immediately released into the reactor core, making it impossible for the reaction to continue.[[13]](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/CANDU_reactor#cite_note-Ref6-13) This is the primary shutdown system of a CANDU reactor.

### Active Safety Features

- **The injecting of neutron "poison"** can be done to greatly diminish the nuclear reaction in the case of emergency.[[2]](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/CANDU_reactor#cite_note-hl-2) This is done by pumps which are driven by a high pressure helium tank; When the reactor is required to shut down, valves between the high pressure helium tank and the gadolinium tanks are opened releasing the helium which drives the gadolinium into the reactor core.[[13]](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/CANDU_reactor#cite_note-Ref6-13) Helium is appropriate for this job because it is doesn’t have the tendency to react.

- **Equipped with an ample supply of light water** so that in the event of a LOCA, cool light water can be quickly mixed with the overheating heavy water coolant to promptly bring the system back down to proper operating temperatures.[[13]](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/CANDU_reactor#cite_note-Ref6-13) This is only used as a last resort as mixing the light and heavy water would mean having to re-purify the heavy water coolant.
