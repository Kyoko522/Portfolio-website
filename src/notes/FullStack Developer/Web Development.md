Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. It can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. There are three kinds of web development specialization: front-end development (the user-facing side), back-end development (the server side), and full-stack development (handling both front-end and back-end technologies).

### Front-End Development
Front-end development involves creating the layout, design, and interactivity of a website using HTML, CSS, and [[JavaScript]]. It’s about everything the user experiences directly:

- **[[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language):** The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
- **JavaScript:** A scripting language that enables interactive web pages.

Popular libraries and frameworks for front-end development include:

- **React (Library):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook.
- **Angular (Framework):** A [[TypeScript]]-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google.
- **Vue.js (Framework):** An open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

### Back-End Development
Back-end development is the server-side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the browser:

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, often used for building back-end services like APIs.
- **Python:** A programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
- **Ruby:** A dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.
- **PHP:** A popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
- [[Go (also known as Golang)]]:** A statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google that is syntactically similar to C but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

Each language might use various frameworks or libraries to speed up the development process like:

- **Express.js for Node.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Django for Python:** A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Rails for Ruby:** A server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License.
- **Laravel for PHP:** A free, open-source PHP web framework, intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

### Databases
Databases are a crucial component of back-end development. Popular databases include:

- **MySQL:** An open-source relational database management system.
- **[[PostgreSQL]]:** A free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
- **MongoDB:** A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

### Full-Stack Development
A full-stack developer is someone who understands both the front and back ends and can handle projects that involve databases, building user-facing websites, or even work with clients during the planning phase of projects.

Web development tools and languages evolve rapidly, and developers often need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies to build efficient and modern web applications.

### Endpoint in Web Development

In the context of web development, particularly in back-end development, an "endpoint" is a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) at which a web service or web API can be accessed by a client application. Endpoints are defined in the server-side of an application and are responsible for handling requests and responses within the API service architecture.

Endpoints are crucial for the functionality of web services and APIs as they allow different applications to communicate with each other over the internet. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific function or resource in a web API, and they are what client applications interact with using HTTP requests methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

Typically, each endpoint provides a different service function, for example:

- `GET /users` - Retrieves a list of users.
- `POST /users` - Creates a new user.
- `GET /users/{id}` - Retrieves a user by ID.
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Updates a user by ID.
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Deletes a user by ID.

[[HTTP response status codes]] are standard codes issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. These codes represent the outcome of the request, helping the client understand the result of their request or the reason why a request failed. Status codes are grouped into five classes:


[[Request]]
