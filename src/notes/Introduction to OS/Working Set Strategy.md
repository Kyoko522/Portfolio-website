- A well-known strategy in the literature, though challenging to implement in a true form.
- The working set is a concept developed by Denning and is crucial to the design of virtual memory management systems.
- The working set for a process at virtual time `t`, denoted as `W(t, τ)`, includes the pages that have been referenced in the last `τ` units of virtual time.

### References

- DENN68, DENN70, DENN80b: Works by Denning that introduced and discussed the working set concept.

## Impact

- The working set model by Denning has had a significant influence on how virtual memory is managed in computing systems.
- It offers a baseline for comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of memory management strategies.
