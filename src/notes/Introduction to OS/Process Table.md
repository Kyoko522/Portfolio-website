There is a primary process table with one entry for each process. Each entry contains, at least, a pointer to a process image. If the process image contains multiple blocks, this information is contained directly in the primary process table or is available by cross-reference to entries in memory tables. Of course, this depiction is generic; a particular OS will have its own way of organizing the location information.
