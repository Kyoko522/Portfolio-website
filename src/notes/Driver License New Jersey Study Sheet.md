Instead gentle pressure should be applied to the brake to bring the vehicle to a controlled stop. With ABS, a motorist should not pump the brakes or violently jerk the wheel. An ABS-equipped vehicle may go out of control at only 35 mph if a motorist violently jerks the steering wheel and brake, even on dry pavement.

### Chapter 4
#### Speed Control 
- 25 Speed Limits -> School zones, business or residential districts 
- 35 Speed Limits -> Suburban business and residential districts
- 50 Speed Limits -> Non-posted rural roadways
- 55 Speed Limits -> Certain state highways (as posted) and interstates

Always slow down:
- On narrow or winding roads
- At intersections or railroad crossings
- On hills 
- At sharp or blind curves.
- Where there are pedestrians or driving hazards 
- When the road is wet or slippery

Always try to go the same speed of traffic as driving to slow and backing up traffic may cause a collisions 

#### Passing

- Both center line are broken: Passing is allowed on both sides 
![[Pasted image 20240519185054.png]]

##### Passing only when safe
- Most passing will happen on the left, the only time overtaking is allowed on the right is when the road is two-more line wide and there is another lane available to pass with

##### A motorist should not pass:
- On a hill or a curve or at any time he/she cannot see far enough ahead 
- At a street crossing or intersection
- At a railroad crossing
- On narrow bridges or in underpasses or tunnels
- When a sign prohibits passing or center lines restrict passing
- When behind a vehicle that has stopped to let a pedestrian cross

##### Keeping to the right
- The New Jersey require motorist must stay in the right lane, except when passing. Motorist must drive on the right half of the roadway unless driving on a one-way street. A motorist must drive a vehicle as close as possible to the right-hand edge or curb of the roadway, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle 

##### Yield the right-of-way

- **Trains:** when a train is approaching a railroad crossing
- **Buses:** when re-entering the flow of traffic
- **Postal vehicles:** when vehicle is seeking to re-enter the flow of traffic
- **Motorized or mobility-assistance devices:** when in a crosswalk or seeking to cross a road
- **Other vehicles that are already in the intersection**

##### Pedestrians in a crossing

- Watch for pedestrians when turning right on red
- Obey speed limits 
- Be sure not to block or park in crosswalks 
- Keep the vehicle's windshield clean for maximum visibility. 
- Be alert for pedestrians at all times
- Be aware of areas where pedestrians are most likely to appear (near schools, town center, residential neighbourhoods, parks)

- Remember that pedestrians are the most vulnerable roadway users. Motorists will be held responsible for maintaining pedestrians safety 

##### Different types of Intersections that you may encounter
- Controlled (an intersection is controlled if there is a traffic signals or signs in any direction or controlled by a police officer)
- Uncontrolled
- Blind (when the motorist doesn't have full visibility of the intersection)
- Traffic Circle

##### Special Highway, Parkway and Turnpike Conditions
- Weave Lane -> an entrance and exit for an expressway. Traffic may come onto and leave the expressway at the same location 
- Highways Through Cities -> The volume of traffic may increase dramatically. Speeds may slow to a crawl. A motorist should drive in the left or center lane to avoid merge conflicts during rush hour. A motorist should search for exits early and adjust position for exit.
- Disable Vehicle -> reduce speed and increase the space between his/her vehicle and the disabled vehicle. This may involve changing lanes.
![[Pasted image 20240519192643.png]]
- Construction Areas -> A motorist should always stay alert for construction-area warning signs. When coming across these areas, a motorist should adjust speed and adjust position to maintain space around his/her vehicle.
- Toll Booths -> A motorist should stay alert for toll booth signs and begin reducing speed early, as traffic may be backed up at the booth. Green lights or signals will highlight open booths. A motorist should be aware of EZ Pass booths and lanes, including high-speed EZ Pass lanes. When exiting toll booths, a motorist should search traffic to both sides for merging potential, accelerate smoothly and adjust speed.

#### Turning Regulations 
##### Right Turn on Red
- A motorist must yield to all oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning right at a red light. Difficult-to-see vehicles, such as bicycles and mopeds, may have a green light, so it is important for a motorist to be aware of their presence.
##### Right Turns
- The motorist should not swing outward or into another lane while making the right turn. He/ she should drive up to the turn as far to the right as possible, keeping close to the right curb or parked vehicles at the curb. This vehicle positioning prior to a right turn reduces the chance of another vehicle being in the space on the right as the motorist makes the turn.

![[Pasted image 20240519194130.png]]

##### Left Turns, Two Vehicles
- When two vehicles meet at an intersection and both have signaled to turn left, extra caution must be applied. When safe, each motorist should turn to the left of the center of the intersection.

##### Left Turn from a one-way road on to a one-way road
- Approaching the turn in the left lane, the motorist should turn into the left lane of the road he/she is entering

##### Left Turn from a two-way road onto a two way road
- Approach the turn as close as possible to the line nearest to the center of the road. When turning, the vehicle should no cross lane markings. The motorist should keep to the right of the center line of the road that the vehicle is entering

![[Pasted image 20240519194150.png]]

##### Left turns, between intersections:
- Between intersections, solid lines show when not to pass. However, these lines may be crossed with care when entering or leaving a driveways in business or residential area

##### Left turn from a two-way road onto a four-lane highway
- Approach the turn as close to the center line of the right side of the road as possible. Make the turn before reaching the center of the intersection
- It is important not to cross lane markings. The motorist should turn into the lane nearest the center line of the right side of the other permits, the motorist should move to the right, out of the passing lane.
