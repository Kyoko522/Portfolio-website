The Divide and Conquer Algorithm is a problem-solving technique used to solve problems by divining the main problem into subproblems, solving them individually and then merging them to find solution to the original problem. 

#### Working of Divide and Conquer Algorithm: 
Divide and Conquer Algorithm can be divided into three steps: Divide, Conquer, and Merge.
##### 1. Divide
- Break down the original problem into smaller subproblems 
- Each subproblem should represent a part of the overall problem 
- The goal is to divide the problem until no further division is possible

##### 2. Conquer
- Solve each of the smaller subproblem individually
- If a subproblem is small enough (often referred to as the 'base case'), we solve it directly without further recursion
- The goal is to find solutions for these subproblems independently 

##### 3. Merge: 
- Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem
- once the smaller subproblems are solved, we recursively combine their solutions to get the solution of larger problem
- the goal is to formulate a solution for the original problem by merging the results from the subproblems
