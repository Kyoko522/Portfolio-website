#### Things that i want to do over the 4 summer vacation
- Work on a project with cloud computing, make a fullstack fantacy sports website where the backend can be a spring boot application that manipulates a sql database and the frontend could be a react or node.js or vue.js
	- host this as a ECS instance on aws 
- make a node.js or vue.js ai chatbot and then you can also have a online chatting system using web sockets and then you can also use web sockets to allow students to sync up youtube videos to study together 
- Work with Arduino and make project with images on my GitHub



### Coding Practice Questions
