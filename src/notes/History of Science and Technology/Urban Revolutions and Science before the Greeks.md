## Urban Revolutions (3500 BCE - 500 BCE)

### Common Characteristics:

- **Agriculture & Hydraulic Management:**
    - Practices include irrigation and flood control.
    - Administrative centralization was crucial.
- **Labor Specialization:**
    - Stone and metal working marked the early industry during Bronze & Iron Ages.
- **Monumental Architecture:**
    - Significant engineering, use of large labor forces, symbol of centralized power/state.
- **Writing Systems:**
    - Essential for communication, record-keeping, and as a knowledge system.
- **Reckoning:**
    - Use of mathematics for practical ends such as bureaucracy, taxation, administration.
- **Calendar Systems:**
    - Regulated communal & state activities like festivals and taxation.
- **Astronomical Knowledge:**
    - Essential for timekeeping and creating star charts.

McLellan & Dorm note that early civilization centers were often in hydraulically stressed regions, implying large-scale agriculture required substantial labor.

### Ancient Mesopotamia:

- **Question to Ponder:** Why did sophisticated early science, particularly astronomy, develop in the "land between the rivers"?
- **Cultural Phases (4000 BCE - 500 BCE):**
    - Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyria.
- **Urban Revolution:**
    - Artist's reconstructions highlight ancient cities like Ur and Mari.
    - Complex governance structures required skilled administrators with numeracy & literacy.

### Writing in Ancient Mesopotamia:

- **2200’s BCE:** Large scale unification under Sargon; Akkadian becomes the lingua franca.
- **1700s BCE:** Hammurabi's rise and the Code of Hammurabi—among the first written laws, many concerning water management.
- **Literature:** Earliest epics like Gilgamesh and Atrahasis emerge.

### Mathematics:

- **Sexagesimal System:**
    - Each place represents a power of 60, prized for its efficiency.
    - This system is still in use today: 60 minutes in an hour, 360 degrees in a circle.

### Mesopotamian Religion:

- **Iconography:** Assyrian sun-god, chaos monster, and other deities.
- **Astral Religion:** A significant part of Mesopotamian culture, with gods representing celestial bodies.

### Integration of Knowledge:

- **Calendrical and Religious Requirements:**
    - Accurate calendars were essential for civic and ceremonial purposes.
    - Religious culture demanded regular natural and astronomical observations.
- **Writing and Mathematics:**
    - Enabled long-term record-keeping and data accumulation.

### Role of Scholars:

- **Ummanu:** Temple scholars or "priest-scientists," advisors to royalty.
- **Primary Function:** Study omens and advise the king on appropriate actions.

### Astronomical Achievements:

- **Notable Discoveries:**
    - Identification of the seven visible planets.
    - Mapping of planets against the backdrop of stars and linking them to omens.
    - Compilation of star risings and ability to predict the new moon crescent.
    - Creation of various accurate calendars.
