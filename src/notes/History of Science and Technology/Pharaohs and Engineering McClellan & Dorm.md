## Reading Notes

### Neolithic Societies

- Neolithic societies were communities that lived in traditional ways; they did not construct temples or large cities, nor did they keep records or establish traditions of higher learning.
- These societies eventually merged into civilizations during what is known as the Urban Revolution.
- This revolution necessitated changes in lifestyle, from residing in huts to houses and adopting more advanced technologies, such as hydraulic systems.
- Agriculture independently originated at least six times around the world:
    - Mesopotamia post-3500 BCE
    - Egypt and the Indus River valley post-2500 BCE
    - China around 3400 BCE
    - Another undetermined location around 1800 BCE
    - Mesoamerica around 500 BCE
    - South America around 300 BCE

### Taming the Rivers

- The reading discusses how different regions utilized rivers, leading to technological advancements.
- Rivers enhanced agricultural land, enriching the soil and enabling robust plant growth.
- People of the Indus River Valley constructed embankments to protect their cities from erratic, silt-laden floods.
- In China circa 2500 BCE, the proliferation of Neolithic villages along rivers led to the rise of kingdoms, focusing on the Mesopotamian region for the initial part of this course.
- Yu the Great, founder of the Xia dynasty, was legendary for his water management in China.
- The Shang dynasty (1520-1030 BCE) controlled the Yellow River plain through extensive irrigation.
- Chinese history is marked by the construction and maintenance of waterworks, resulting in an infrastructure that includes dikes, dams, canals, and artificial lakes.
- Early Chinese civilization was also known for constructing cities, palaces, and ceremonial centers within protective walls.
- A unified government was established in 221 BCE under an emperor, commanding an estimated 60 million people.
- Besides water management, the Great Wall of China and the Grand Canal were monumental achievements of Chinese civilization.

### Swamps and Deserts

- The Urban Revolution was a grand experiment in human social and cultural development.
- The Americas saw a transition from hunting-gathering societies to settled Neolithic villages by 1500 BCE.
- Water management was crucial in the Western Hemisphere, supporting the hydraulic hypothesis of civilization development.
- Similar developments occurred in South America.

### Men of Metal (Specialized Labor)

- The advent of irrigation technology and urban civilization marked a pivotal and irreversible shift in the history of technology and human society.
- The Bronze Age signaled mastery over metal, offering several advantages over stone.
- Metalworking encompassed complex techniques like mining ore and smelting, and crafting tools at temperatures exceeding 1100 degrees Celsius.
- Control over mineral resources became significant in early civilizations.
- Specialized crafts emerged as full-time occupations, fulfilling society's growing demand for skilled labor.
- This period also saw the beginning of the appreciation for jewelry and other valuable materials.
- Beer and other intoxicating beverages were invented, representing a new use of resources.
- The use of animal muscle, such as oxen for plowing and horses for transportation, was another development in this era.

### Pyramids

- The Great Pyramid at Giza is the largest solid-stone structure ever built, reflecting the advanced engineering of Egyptian civilization.
- Pyramid construction taught ancient engineers mechanical techniques, such as using cantilevered machines for lifting stones.
- Pyramids served not only as grand tombs but also as state-building projects, symbolizing and literalizing the cohesion of the society.

### Writing

- Knowledge in early civilizations was primarily applied to practical purposes like administration, economics, and architecture.
- Writing was developed for permanent record-keeping, with most early documents pertaining to economic and administrative affairs.
- Literacy became a path to power, and schools for reading and writing emerged globally.

### Reckoning (Mathematics)

- Mathematics developed alongside writing, fulfilling similar practical needs.
- The Sumerians and Babylonians utilized a base-60 number system, remnants of which persist in modern timekeeping.
- Although the principles behind calculations were not fully understood, their practical applications were clear and reliable.
- Calendars, especially the accurate Mesopotamian one in place by 1000 BCE, played a crucial role in the organization of society.

### Time, The Gods, and the Heavens

- By 1000 BCE, calendars had become highly accurate, with the Mesopotamian one predicting lunar cycles well into the future.
- Babylonian astronomers excelled in charting celestial movements, with extensive records dating from 747 BCE.
- Their knowledge in astronomy influenced later civilizations, including the Greeks.
- The Babylonians could predict astronomical events with great precision, contributing to various aspects of cultural and societal activities.
