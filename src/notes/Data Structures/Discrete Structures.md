###  Course Overview and Notes

#### 1. Induction and Recursion

**Overview:** Methods to define and solve problems based on their smaller instances or previous cases.

- **Mathematical Induction:**
    - _Base Case:_ Establish initial condition is true.
    - _Inductive Step:_ Assume true for `n` and prove for `n+1`.
- **Recursive Algorithms:**
    - _Design:_ Break a problem into sub-problems.
    - _Base Case:_ Directly solve small enough problems.

#### 2. Graph Theory

**Overview:** Study of graphs as mathematical structures to model relationships and solve related problems.

- **Graph Basics:**
    - _Types of Graphs:_ Directed vs. Undirected.
    - _Paths and Trees:_ Special sequences of vertices and edges.
- **Graph Algorithms:**
    - _Applications:_ Finding shortest paths, cycle detection, etc.

#### 3. [[Regular Expression and Finite Automata]]

**Overview:** Tools for pattern matching and designing simple models of computation.

- **Regular Expressions:**
    - _Syntax:_ Language rules for pattern creation.
    - _Matching:_ Techniques to find or replace text patterns.
- **Finite Automata:**
    - _DFA:_ Deterministic model with one outcome per input.
    - _NFA:_ Non-deterministic model with multiple possible outcomes.

#### 4. [[Counting and Probabilities]]

**Overview:** Mathematical techniques to quantify possibilities and likelihood of events.

- **Counting:**
    - _Permutations and Combinations:_ Arrangements and selections.
    - _Principles:_ Addition and multiplication rules.
- **Probability:**
    - _Fundamentals:_ Axioms and conditional probabilities.
    - _Bayes' Theorem:_ Calculating reverse conditional probabilities.

These topics form the pillars of discrete structures, providing a fundamental framework for understanding complex computational problems and creating efficient algorithms. Each section warrants deep exploration through problem-solving and applications to fully grasp the concepts and techniques.
