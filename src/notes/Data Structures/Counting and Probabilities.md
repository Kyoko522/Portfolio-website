## Introduction to Basic Counting

- **Multiplication Rule**
    - Concept of performing operations in steps with multiple ways per step.
- **Set Cardinality**
    - Concerns the number of elements within a set.
- **Pigeonhole Principle**
    - Asserts that if the number of objects is greater than the number of containers, at least one container must contain more than one object.

## Practical Examples

### Coin Tossing

- **Single Toss**:
    - Participants use either a real or virtual coin to record results in TopHat.
    - Questions revolve around the prediction and actual outcomes of the toss.
- **Double Toss**:
    - Similar to the single toss but with two tosses.
    - Queries if the order of toss affects the outcome.

### Dice Roll

- Explores randomness in rolling dice in a controlled environment.

## Calculating Probabilities

- Understanding and calculating probabilities requires knowledge of combinatorics and counting sample spaces and events.

## Detailed Counting Concepts

### Multiplication Rule

- Elaborated with examples like counting possible binary numbers with a set number of bits, elements in Cartesian products, and possible Canadian postal codes.

### Set Cardinality

- Explained through bijections, finite and infinite sets, and calculating the size of sets.
- Highlights different cardinalities, countable vs. uncountable sets, and applications in determining set sizes.

### Properties of Finite Sets

- Rules for adding, subtracting, and comparing cardinalities.
- Inclusion/exclusion principles for combining set sizes.

### Pigeonhole Principle

- Demonstrated through scenarios like ensuring a match in birth months or socks from a drawer.
- Generalized to explain outcomes in larger groups, like a classroom or a set of postal codes.

## Classroom Examples and Problems

- Problems are designed to apply learned counting principles to estimate and calculate probabilities in practical scenarios such as code executions and class distributions.
