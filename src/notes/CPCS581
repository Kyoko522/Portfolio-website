- The andeomeda Galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away from us, whcih means that if we were to see 1000 light years away, this means that you are seeing a 1000 years in the past as it take 1000 years for that light to arrive on earth.

Note: That are visiable Universe is 4 billion light year anything further away doesn't mean that it doesn't exist it just means that it hasn't had enought time to get to us, therfore not visiable

Motions of the Galaxies
    Distant galaxies are moving -> Away from us
    Need to look into the Hubbles law 

The Everywhere Strech -> AKA Big Bang 
    - In short the Big Bang was an event that happened everywhere in space



The laws of physics
    In the universe there are 4 fources 
         1. Strong force blinds the nucleus
         2. Weak force in radioactive decay
         3. Electromegnetic force vinds atoms
         4. Gravitational force binds the solar system

### The Planks Era 
    This was an era that time before 10^-43s and when temperature which is less then 10^32. It was a really small time, where we don't know exactly how much energy something has. IT was a substantial energy/mass flutuations from point to point. During this era that was only force that was known it was called the super force. 

### The GUT ERA
The GUT Era was between the time of 10^-43s to 10^-38S and temperatures between 10^32 to 10^29K. During this era gravity 'freezed out' in other works it was when gravity branched out from the super force, and alone with that unified force which was the combination of strong, weak and electromegnetic forces that we know of today. 

Near the end of this era, the strong force starts to freeze out, releasing huge energies

Note: That the Observable Universe value is 13.8 light years in radius as that it the known age of the usiverse, but the 'Ture Observable Universe is ~46 billion light-years in radius'

### Electroweak Era
This era is between the time of 10^-38 to 10^-10s and temperatures of 10^29K to 10^15K. this era has 3 fundamental forces (gravity, strong force, and electroweak). In this era it was alsot 

### The Particle Era
this is the a millisecond after the big bang where it's still 100 million times hotter than the core of the sun
we can replicate this temeprature in supcollider, so we actually have firected ecperimetal ecvidence of what the universe was like beginning from this point. 

Note: the era before the Paricle Era is based of math and theories there was no actually experiments taht can be before to test these theories.
