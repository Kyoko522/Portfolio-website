- The andeomeda Galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away from us, whcih means that if we were to see 1000 light years away, this means that you are seeing a 1000 years in the past as it take 1000 years for that light to arrive on earth.

Note: That are visiable Universe is 4 billion light year anything further away doesn't mean that it doesn't exist it just means that it hasn't had enought time to get to us, therfore not visiable

Motions of the Galaxies
    Distant galaxies are moving -> Away from us
    Need to look into the Hubbles law 

The Everywhere Strech -> AKA Big Bang 
    - In short the Big Bang was an event that happened everywhere in space



The laws of physics
    In the universe there are 4 fources 
         1. Strong force blinds the nucleus
         2. Weak force in radioactive decay
         3. Electromegnetic force vinds atoms
         4. Gravitational force binds the solar system

### The Planks Era 
    This was an era that time before 10^-43s and when temperature which is less then 10^32. It was a really small time, where we don't know exactly how much energy something has. IT was a substantial energy/mass flutuations from point to point. During this era that was only force that was known it was called the super force. 

### The GUT ERA
The GUT Era was between the time of 10^-43s to 10^-38S and temperatures between 10^32 to 10^29K. During this era gravity 'freezed out' in other works it was when gravity branched out from the super force, and alone with that unified force which was the combination of strong, weak and electromegnetic forces that we know of today. 

Near the end of this era, the strong force starts to freeze out, releasing huge energies

Note: That the Observable Universe value is 13.8 light years in radius as that it the known age of the usiverse, but the 'Ture Observable Universe is ~46 billion light-years in radius'

### Electroweak Era
This era is between the time of 10^-38 to 10^-10s and temperatures of 10^29K to 10^15K. this era has 3 fundamental forces (gravity, strong force, and electroweak). In this era it was alsot 

### The Particle Era
this is the a millisecond after the big bang where it's still 100 million times hotter than the core of the sun
we can replicate this temeprature in supcollider, so we actually have firected ecperimetal ecvidence of what the universe was like beginning from this point. 

Note: the era before the Paricle Era is based of math and theories there was no actually experiments taht can be before to test these theories.

### Era of Nucleosynthesis
This era was 5 minutes after the big bang, at this point there was no antimatter, proton and neutrosn were the only thing left, But it was still so hot enough where fusion could still take place. This is where we had hydrogen which fused to produce hellium 

### Era of Nuclei
Between 5 minutes to 380 000 years after the Big Bang, and Temperature reaching between 10^9 and 3000K. It was a point where the temperature had dropped where fusion was not possible any long, but still to hot for any atoms. From here, universe is a hot plasma of H, He, and electrons. Ionized, so there are no entural atoms, just nuclei. 

Photons bounce around rapidly, inonizing naytghing that tries to capture electorons. Universe expands and cools, until it reaches 3000K (half the temperature of the Sun's surface)

### Era of Nuclei/Era of Atoms
This was a 380 000 years after the Big Bang, where temperatures had dropped to 3000K. At this point, H and He nuclei captures electrons, forming stable atoms. The univerese become transparent, Moving from a state where light isn't able to move without bouncing of another into another electron, to a state where light are able to freely travel long distance without bouncing another electron.

This is the furthest back we will ever be able to see once we get pass this point in the past it's nothing but space that is fog where light is unable to travel, this is a acalled the cosmic microwave background
