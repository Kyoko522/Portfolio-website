## Fundamental Concepts

### Light and Distance
- **Andromeda Galaxy**: 2.5 million light-years away
- When we see light from 1000 light-years away, we're seeing 1000 years into the past
- Light takes time to travel, so distant observations show the past
- **Example**: If we see a supernova in Andromeda, it actually exploded 2.5 million years ago

Notes: That are visiable Universe is 4 billion light year anything further away doesn't mean that it doesn't exist it just menas that it hasn't time to get to us, therefore not visiable 

### Observable Universe
- **Age of Universe**: 13.8 billion years
- **Observable Universe**: 13.8 billion light-years in radius (based on age)
- **True Observable Universe**: ~46 billion light-years in radius (due to expansion)
- Anything further away exists but hasn't had enough time for light to reach us
- **Question**: Can we see past 14 billion light-years? No, because the universe is only 13.8 billion years old

### Galaxy Motion and Hubble's Law
- Distant galaxies are moving **away from us**
- The Universe is expanding everywhere (Hubble's Law)
- This expansion led to the Big Bang theory
- **Not** galaxies moving through space, but space itself expanding

## The Four Fundamental Forces

1. **Strong Force**: Binds atomic nuclei together
2. **Weak Force**: Involved in radioactive decay, affects neutrinos and WIMPs
3. **Electromagnetic Force**: Binds atoms together
4. **Gravitational Force**: Binds solar systems and large-scale structures

### Force Comparison
- **Strength**: Electromagnetic force is stronger than gravity
- **Large scales**: Gravity and electromagnetic forces dominate
- **Small scales**: Strong and weak forces dominate
- **Question**: Could atoms exist when there was only one unified force? No, because there was no electromagnetic force to bind electrons

---

## The Big Bang and Early Universe

### Key Concept: The Everywhere Stretch
- The Big Bang was **not** an explosion at a point in space
- It was an event that happened **everywhere in space**
- Space itself expanded, carrying matter with it
- **Common misconception**: Big Bang as explosion throwing matter out from a center

### Physics Limitations
- We can calculate backwards to within 10⁻⁴³ seconds of the Big Bang using current physics
- Earlier than that, the laws of physics change or break down
- With cutting-edge theories, we might push to 10⁻⁴³ seconds after Big Bang

### Timeline of the Early Universe

#### 1. Planck Era
- **Time**: < 10⁻⁴³ seconds after Big Bang
- **Temperature**: > 10³² K
- Only one "super force" existed
- Substantial energy/mass fluctuations from quantum mechanics
- **No particles or photons** - everything is unified
- Physics breaks down before this point

#### 2. GUT Era (Grand Unified Theory)
- **Time**: 10⁻⁴³ to 10⁻³⁸ seconds
- **Temperature**: 10³² to 10²⁹ K
- **Gravity "freezes out"** - separates from the super force
- Remaining unified force combines strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces
- Near the end: strong force begins to freeze out, releasing huge energies
- **Inflation occurs**: Universe expands by factor of 10³⁰ in 10⁻³⁶ seconds
- **Faster than light expansion**: Space itself can expand faster than light

#### 3. Electroweak Era
- **Time**: 10⁻³⁸ to 10⁻¹⁰ seconds
- **Temperature**: 10²⁹ to 10¹⁵ K
- Three fundamental forces exist: gravity, strong force, and electroweak force
- Radiation collisions produce matter and antimatter particles
- Elementary particles: photons, gluons, and quarks
- Matter and antimatter annihilate to produce radiation

#### 4. Particle Era
- **Time**: 10⁻¹⁰ seconds to 10⁻³ seconds (1 millisecond)
- **Temperature**: 10¹⁵ to 10¹² K
- Still 100 million times hotter than the Sun's core
- **We can replicate these conditions** in supercolliders
- **Direct experimental evidence** begins from this point
- All four fundamental forces now exist
- Spontaneous production of protons, neutrons, electrons
- **Matter-antimatter asymmetry**: For every billion antiparticles, there were billion + 1 particles
- **Key question**: If matter and antimatter were exactly equal, only radiation/energy would exist now

#### 5. Era of Nucleosynthesis
- **Time**: 1 millisecond to 5 minutes
- **Temperature**: 10¹² to 10⁹ K
- Antimatter has been annihilated
- Only protons and neutrons remain
- Temperature still hot enough for **nuclear fusion**
- **Hydrogen (single proton) fuses to produce helium**
- Big Bang nucleosynthesis creates light elements

#### 6. Era of Nuclei
- **Time**: 5 minutes to 380,000 years
- **Temperature**: 10⁹ to 3,000 K
- Fusion no longer possible, but still too hot for neutral atoms
- Universe is a hot plasma of H, He nuclei, and free electrons
- **Ionized state** - no neutral atoms, just nuclei
- Photons bounce around rapidly, ionizing anything trying to capture electrons
- Universe expands and cools toward 3,000 K (half Sun's surface temperature)

#### 7. Era of Atoms (Recombination)
- **Time**: 380,000 years after Big Bang
- **Temperature**: 3,000 K
- **H and He nuclei capture electrons** → stable neutral atoms form
- **Universe becomes transparent** (like fog lifting)
- Photons can finally travel freely without bouncing off electrons
- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** forms
- **This is the furthest back we can ever see** - before this is opaque

#### 8. Era of Galaxies
- Neutral atoms exist alongside ionized plasma and CMB light
- **Slightly denser regions** begin forming stars
- First starlight ends the "Dark Age"
- After ~1 billion years: first galaxies form
- **We still live in this era**

## Critical Density and Cosmic Composition

### Critical Density Concept
- Universe was thrown apart by expansion
- Matter has gravity, which pulls space back together
- **Critical density**: the amount of matter needed to eventually stop expansion
- If density > critical → universe recollapses (Big Crunch)
- If density < critical → universe expands forever
- **Current universe**: appears to be at exactly critical density

### Evidence from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
- Amounts of rare deuterium, helium-3, and lithium match models
- These observations show normal matter is only **5% of critical density**
- But universe appears to be at 100% critical density
- **Missing 95%**: Must be unknown forms of matter and energy

### Dark Matter
- **Amount**: ~27% of universe (6 times more than normal matter)
- **Properties**: 
  - Invisible to electromagnetic radiation
  - Interacts gravitationally
  - Does not collide with itself like normal gas
  - Could exist in solar system and on Earth
- **Evidence**:
  - Galaxy rotation curves (stars orbit faster than expected)
  - Galaxy cluster orbits (too fast for visible matter alone)
  - Gravitational lensing effects
  - CMB variations
  - Structure formation patterns
- **Dark matter halos**: Contain ~10 times as much mass as all stars in galaxy

### Dark Energy  
- **Amount**: ~68% of universe
- **Effect**: Causes accelerating expansion of universe
- **Discovery**: Through Type Ia supernova observations (standard candles)
- Big Bang should cause expansion to slow down due to gravity
- Instead, expansion is speeding up
- **Nature**: Completely unknown - could be cosmological constant

### Universe Composition Summary
- **Normal matter (stars, gas)**: 5%
  - Stars themselves: only 0.5%
  - Hydrogen and Helium gas: 4%
- **Dark matter**: 27%
- **Dark energy**: 68%

## **Quantum Mechanics and Reality**

### **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**
- **Core concept**: Cannot measure both position and momentum precisely simultaneously
- **For electrons**: Position OR speed can be known precisely, but not both
- **Nature**: Not a measurement limitation - fundamentally impossible
- **Key insight**: Electron with well-known momentum cannot have knowable position

Questions: Electron orbiting a nucleus -> Position with some uncertainty in you know one thing you can't 100% no the other

### **Wave-Particle Duality**
- **Interference patterns produced by**:
  - Light waves
  - Electrons (quantum behavior)
  - NOT classical particles (paint balls)
- **Fundamental question**: Did electron have precise position before measurement?

### **Quantum Interpretations**
- **Copenhagen Interpretation**: Reality is fundamentally probabilistic
- **Many-Worlds Interpretation**: All quantum states exist in parallel universes
- **Schrödinger's Cat**: Demonstrates superposition - cat alive AND dead simultaneously
- **Reality check**: Real cats aren't quantum systems (thought experiment only)
- **Scientific resolution**: Requires predictive tests to determine truth

- **Dark Matter**: Patch to keep galaxies together? -> Emergent Strategy
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Resolution limit of reality? -> Ultra-Reductionist Strategy

### **Escape Velocity Principles**
- **Earth's escape velocity**: 11.3 km/s regardless of launch direction
- **Mass and size effects**: Escape velocity increases with mass and decreases with radius
- **Solar escape velocity**: 617 km/s from Sun's surface
- **Speed of light limit**: Maximum possible escape velocity is speed of light (300,000,000 m/s)

### **Schwarzschild Radius Calculations**
- **Mathematical derivation**: r = 2GM/c² where escape velocity equals speed of light
- **Solar example**: Sun's Schwarzschild radius = 3 km
- **Mass proportionality**: Schwarzschild radius directly proportional to mass
- **General formula**: R_Sch = M* (3km) = 3M* km for stellar mass objects

### **Event Horizon Properties**
- **Definition boundary**: Point where light cannot escape
- **Size relationship**: Object becomes black hole when compressed below Schwarzschild radius
- **Proximity effects**: Can approach and escape from distances greater than Schwarzschild radius
- **Information barrier**: No information can escape from within event horizon

### **Orbital Effects**
