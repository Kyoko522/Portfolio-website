#### Backend
Grit is primarily designed to handle user authentication and management through a RESTful API developed using the [[Go (also known as Golang)]] with the Gin framework. It leverages JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication, which is crucial for maintaining sessions and securing user-related operations.

### Components and Functionalities

1. **User Authentication**:
    
    - **Sign Up and Login**: Users can register and log into the system. During registration, user details such as email and password are collected. The password is hashed for security before being stored in the database, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
    - **Token Generation**: Upon successful login, a JWT is generated. This token includes claims such as the userâ€™s ID (`sub`) and the token's expiration time (`exp`). This token is crucial for subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize user actions.

1. **Middleware for Security**:
    
    - **JWT Validation**: A middleware component intercepts incoming HTTP requests to secure endpoints. It checks for a valid JWT in the cookies, validates this token, and ensures it has not expired. This middleware also retrieves the user ID embedded in the token to fetch user details from the database and verifies the user exists.
    - **User Context**: Once the JWT is verified, user details are attached to the context of the request, making them accessible in subsequent processing handlers. This approach ensures that every secured endpoint can access user details securely and efficiently without repeatedly querying the database.

1. **Endpoints**:
    
    - Various endpoints handle user-related operations, such as retrieving user data, updating records, and more. These endpoints rely on the middleware for security, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests are processed.

### How It Works

- When a request is made to a secured endpoint, the middleware first checks for a valid JWT. If the token is valid and the user exists in the database, the request is allowed to proceed; otherwise, it is aborted with an unauthorized status.
- For user registration and login, the system handles data validation, password hashing, and token generation, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.
- The use of JWT allows for stateless authentication, which is scalable and efficient as it does not require server-side session storage.

### Pros

- **Scalability**: The stateless nature of JWT makes your application scalable as it does not rely on server-side session storage.
- **Security**: Using hashed passwords and JWT for authentication enhances security. JWTs ensure that user credentials are not repeatedly transmitted over the network after login.
- **Efficiency**: By verifying tokens via middleware and attaching user details to the request context, the system reduces the need for repeated database queries, enhancing performance.
- **Flexibility**: The RESTful architecture makes it easy to expand or modify endpoints as your application's needs grow or change.

### Cons

- **Token Storage and Management**: While JWT is secure, improper handling of token storage on the client side can lead to security risks. If tokens are stolen, malicious activities can be performed on behalf of the user until the token expires.
- **Complexity in Token Invalidations**: Unlike session-based authentication, revoking JWTs immediately (before they expire) can be complex and may require additional infrastructure, such as a token blacklist.
- **Error Handling**: Properly managing and responding to various authentication errors requires careful design to ensure that security loopholes are not introduced.
