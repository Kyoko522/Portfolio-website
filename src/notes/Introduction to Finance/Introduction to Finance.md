### Topics And Learning Objective

##### Business General
- What is a business and what does it do?
	 The activity for making, buying, or selling goods or providing services in exchange for money. 

	 As for what a business does depends on which business sectors a business is in. Business is divided into one of three main business sectors. 
	1. **Primary Sector** where they grow and gather raw materials (eg. potato farms, coal mining, oil drilling)
	2. **Secondary Sector** where raw material are turned into products (e.g. car manufacturing, cardboard box factory, frozen food factory)
	3. **Tertiary Sector** where goods and services are sold to consumers (e.g. restaurants, hairdressers, music stores)
		This includes:
		- service businesses
		- merchandising businesses
		- etc. 

##### Business Stakeholders
- Who are a business's stakeholders and what are they interested in?
	Stakeholder are people who care about businesses. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who either affect the business or are affected by the actions of the business. All stakeholders have objectives - something they want from their relationship with the business. 
	
	**Internal stakeholders** work for the business. Their objectives generally relate to their ability to keep their jobs, do their jobs more efficiently, get promoted, and get paid for their work.

- What information do stakeholders need and use?
	The financial information a business provides is often the key information that external stakeholders use to make decisions. By better understanding the stakeholders and their objectives, we can better understand the need for financial information and how important it is that stakeholders can depend on that information for their decision-making.

	Companies record their business transactions in an accounting system: an information system that collects, groups, and communicates a business's financial position, including its financial health and profitability. Without accounting information, stakeholders would not be able to make decisions that help them meet their needs.

	Internal stakeholders have access to all the accounting information because they work in the business. They can use the accounting system to answer whatever questions they might have on a daily basis. External stakeholders do not have access to the business's accounting system because they are outside the business. Instead, they depend on the financial statements that businesses produce. External stakeholders use the financial statements to analyze a business and answer questions, which allows them to make decisions and meet their objectives. 

##### Qualities of finance information
- What qualities must financial information have to make to make it useful for decision making?
	All the qualities are called **qualitative characteristics**: quantities that stakeholder : want financial information to have so they can use the information for decision making. Let's look at each of the qualities that external stakeholders want.

| Quality        | Description                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Faithful       | Truthful, meaning it is complete, free of error, and natural (unbiased).                                                     |
| Relevant       | Applicable or pertient to your descition making, helps you perdict the future and/or confirm decisions you made in the past. |
| Comparable     | Can compare the same business from year to year OR between two different businesses in the same industry.                    |
| Verifiable     | Anyone looking at the information would determine similar amounts                                                            |
| Timely         | Information is provided quickly (as old information is less useful).                                                         |
| Understandable | Group and present information so it is clear and concise.                                                                    |



- How are qualitative characteristics use to produce useful information?
	The qualitative characteristics are part of the standards (also called guidelines) accountants use to prepare financial information for external stakeholders. We know that information must be faithful, relevant, comparable, verifiable, timely, and understandable in order to be useful. 
	
	In order to use information to make decisions, it is important to understand the quality of that information (how trustworthy it is). If information does not have these qualitative characteristics then it may mislead the stakeholders, causing them to make wrong decisions.

	You know the definition of each of the qualitative characteristics and why they are important for decision making; however, being able to apply that knowledge is critical. For testing purposes in this course, you must be able to read a scenario (a short story about a situation or an event), name the qualitative characteristic that applies, and explain whether the qualitative characteristic is being followed or not followed (violated).
##### Assumptions underlying financial information
- What assumptions are made about financial information generally?
	The qualitative characteristics are sued to develop assumptions that specify how accountants must record measure, and report information. 

Assumptions Underlying Financial Information

| Assumption                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Separate Entity           | Only the activities of the business are included in the business's financial information                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Unit-of-Measure           | All transactions must be reported using the same monetary unit. Usually this is the monetary unit of the country that business's head office is located in, even if the business has offices is located in, even if the business has offices in many countries |
| Going Concern             | Businesses will continue their operations well into the future                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Historic Cost             | Purchases should be recorded at the amount that was paid for them.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Time Period (Periodicity) | Information is broken into artificial time periods such as a month, quarter or year, so that stakeholders can analyze and compare information to make decisions.                                                                                               |
| Full Disclosure           | If something will affect the decisions of the external stakeholders, it must be reported.                                                                                                                                                                      |

- How do these assumptions related to and support the qualitative characteristics?
	The qualitative characteristics and assumptions were developed as guidelines to help accountants record, measure, and report information to external shareholders. Their use helps to ensure that financial information encompasses all the qualitative characteristics of useful information: _faithful, relevant, comparable, verifiable, timely, and understandable_.

	Because the assumptions are based on the qualitative characteristics, you should be able to connect each of the characteristics to one or more of the assumptions (Separate Entity, Unit-of-Measure, Going Concern, Historic Cost, Time Period, Full Disclosure).

##### GAAP
- What is GAAP and what is it used for?
	The qualitative characteristics and underlying assumptions are generally accepted accounting principles Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. 

	Preparers of accounting information use GAAP as a guideline when preparing financial accounting information. The overall objective of GAAP is to provide financial information about a business that is useful to external stakeholders for decision making.
