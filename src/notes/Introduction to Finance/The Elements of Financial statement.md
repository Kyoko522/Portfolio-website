#### 1. Why does Financial Information Matter
- To manage a business, you need financial information to make inform decisions
- Simply knowing basic financial elements (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses) is not enough
- Using the **expanded accounting equation** gives more insight, but still lacks the detail needed for decision making. 
#### 2. How Accounts Improve Financial Information
- Account subdivide finance reporting elements to provide more detailed information. 
	- Cash (to know how much liquid money is available)
	- Office Supplies (to track spending on supplies)
	- Business License (to account for registration cost)
#### 3. Accounts Help Produce Financial Statements
- Financial statements tell a business's story by showing:
	- Finance performance (profit/loss)
	- Current financial position (assets and liabilities)
	- Cash flow (how money moves in and out)
- Both internal (owners, managers) and external (investors, banks) stakeholders use financial statements to analyze the business. 
#### 4. Standard Accounts in Business
- Businesses use standard accounts to categorize financial transactions
- Instead of just listing account definitions, the course teaches this concept through a real-world example:
	- You start a lawn care business and track transactions
	- First analyze transactions using financial elements
	- Then, use accounts to record and classify those transactions
- As you progress in the course, you'll expand your list of standard accounts

#### Is Every Business Activity Recorded in the Accounting System?
What is an Event vs. a Transaction?
- A business event is any activity that is important to the business
- Not all events are recorded in the accounting systems.
- For an event to be recorded, it must meet two conditions
	1. Measurable - It has a dollar amount
	2. Realized - the exchange has already happen
If both conditions are met, the event becomes a transaction and is recorded in the accounting system

If an event is **measurable but not realized**, OR **realized but not measurable**, it **is NOT a transaction** and is **not recorded**.

A transaction usually involves an exchange between two parties
- Goods or services go one way
- Cash (or a promise to pay) goes the other way
A transaction does not have to involve cash immediately
- If goods/services are delivered first and cash is paid later, it created receivable(money owned to the business)
- If cash is paid first and goods/services are delivered later, it creates payable (money the business owes)
