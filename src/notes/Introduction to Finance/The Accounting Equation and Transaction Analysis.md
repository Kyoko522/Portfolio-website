Business activities are stored in the Accounting Information System (AIS). The AIS is built around financial statements, which tell the story of the business: what it does and how well it performs.

The end goal of an AIS is the creation of financial statements, which summarize the business's financial performance and cash flow.

 **Financial Statements**: Financial statements are used to make resource allocation decisions.
